**3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
```
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
```
Example 1:
```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int length = 0, start = 0, end = 0;
        Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        while (end < s.length()) {
            if (map.containsKey(s.charAt(end))) {
                start = Math.max(map.get(s.charAt(end)), start);
            }
            length = Math.max(length, end - start + 1);
            map.put(s.charAt(end), end + 1);
            end++;
        }
        return length;
    }
}
```

**159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters**
```
Given a string S, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most two distinct characters.

Output: 3
Explanation: tis "ece" which its length is 3.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "ccaabbb"
Output: 5
